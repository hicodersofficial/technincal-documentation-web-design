                JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or
                just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class
                functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting
                language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also
                use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
                JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm,
                single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
                object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g.
                functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself,
                and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other
                host environments. For information about API specifics to
                Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.

                This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A general understanding of the Internet and the World
                    Wide <code>Web (WWW)</code> .
                </li>
                <li>
                    Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language
                    <code>(HTML)</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some programming experience. If you are new to
                    programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main
                    page about <code>JavaScript</code>.

            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Java_vs_Javascript">
            <header>
                <h1>Java vs JavaScript</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
                <code>JavaScript</code> and <code>Java</code> are similar in
                some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's
                static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows
                most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
                control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
                renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </p>

            <p>
                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built
                by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based
                on a small number of data types representing
                <code>numeric</code>, <code>Boolean</code> , and
                <code>string</code> values. JavaScript has a prototype-based
                object model instead of the more common class-based object
                model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
                individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions
                without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
                be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
                methods.
            </p>

            <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java.
                You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and
                methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether
                methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not
                have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
                function return types are not explicitly typed.

                JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web
                technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites
                will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.

                However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more
                challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. You
                may have to start small, and progress gradually. To begin,
                let's examine how to add JavaScript to your page for
                creating a Hello world! example. (Hello world! is the
                standard for introductory programming examples.)
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Go to your test site and create a new folder named
                    scripts. Within the scripts folder, create a new file
                    called <code>main.js</code>, and save it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In your <code>index.html</code> file, enter this code on
                    a new line, just before the closing
                    <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag:
                </li>
                <pre><code>&lt;script src="./scripts/main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
                <li>
                    This is doing the same job as the
                    <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element for <code>CSS</code>.
                    It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an
                    effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything
                    else on the page).
                </li>
                <li>Add this code to the <code>main.js</code> file:</li>
                <pre><code>const myHeading = document.querySelector("h1"); <br/> myHeading.textContent = "Hello world!";        </code></pre>
                <li>
                    Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved. Then
                    load <code>index.html</code> in your browser. You should
                    see something like this:<img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9543/hello-world.png"
                        style="
                                display: block;
                                height: 236px;
                                margin: 0px auto;
                                margin-top: 20px;
                                width: 100%;
                            " />
                </li>
            </ol>

        <div class="note margin">
            <p>
                <strong>Note</strong>: The reason the instructions (above)

                <strong>the browser reads code in the order it appears in the
                    file</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the JavaScript loads first and it is supposed to affect
                the HTML that hasn't loaded yet, there could be problems.
                Placing JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML page is one
                way to accommodate this dependency. To learn more about
                alternative approaches, see

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>
                <h1>Variables</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your
                application. The names of variables, called
                <code>identifiers</code>, conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                A JavaScript <code>identifier</code> must start with a
                <code>letter</code>, <code>underscore (_)</code>, or
                <code>dollar sign ($)</code>; subsequent characters can also
                be <code>digits (0-9)</code>. Because JavaScript is case
                sensitive, letters include the characters
                <code> "A"</code> through <code>"Z"</code> (uppercase) and
                the characters <code>"a" </code> through
                <code> "z"</code> (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
                identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences
                as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names
                are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
            <header>
                <h1>Declaring variables</h1>
            </header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
            <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <pre><code> var x = 42; </code></pre>
            <p>
                This syntax can be used to declare both local and global
                variables.
            </p>
            <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <pre><code> x = 42; </code></pre>
            <p>
                This always declares a global variable. It generates a
                strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
            </p>
            <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <pre><code> let y = 13; </code></pre>
            <p>
                This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local
                variable. See Variable scope below.
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
            <header>
                <h1>Data types</h1>
            </header>
            <p>
                The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Six data types that are <code>primitives</code>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>Boolean</code>. true and false.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>null</code>. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is
                            case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>undefined</code>. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>Number</code>. 42 or 3.14159.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>String</code>. "Howdy"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015)</code>. A data type whose instances are unique and
                            immutable.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>
                    and <code>Object</code>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions
                with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You
                can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application
                can perform.

        <section class="main-section" id="If...else_Statement">
            <header>
                <h1>If...else Statement</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause
                to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
            <pre><code> if (condition)  { 
     statement_1;   
 else {             
     statement_2;   
 }                 </code></pre>
            <p>
                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what
                evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, <code>statement_1</code> is executed;
                otherwise, <code>statement_2</code> is executed. <code>statement_1</code> and <code>statement_2</code>
                can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as
                follows:
            </p>

            <pre><code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;   
        } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }</code></pre>

            <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be
                executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general,
                it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:</p>
            <pre><code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
        statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else { 
        statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;

            <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be
                confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:</p>
            <pre><code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code></pre>
            <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional
                parentheses around the assignment. For example:</p>
            <pre><code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code></pre>

                Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide
                introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.

            </header>
            <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the
                function keyword, followed by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the function.</li>
                <li>
                    A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.
                </li>


            </ul>
            <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
            <pre><code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code></pre>
            The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to
            return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies
            the value returned by the function.

            return number * number;
            Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the
            function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or
            in the calling function.
